# R2GQA: Retriever-Reader-Generator Question Answering System to Support Students Understanding Legal Regulations in Higher Education

## üîç Introduction

**R2GQA** is an automated question answering system designed to assist students in comprehending legal regulations related to higher education. It leverages a combination of modern information retrieval and natural language processing techniques to deliver accurate and user-friendly answers in Vietnamese.

The system consists of three main components working together:

   Combines **BM25** and **SBERT** to identify and fetch the most relevant legal text passages from a large corpus based on the user‚Äôs question.

2. **Reader**
   Utilizes transformer-based models such as **XLM-RoBERTa-large** to extract precise answers from the retrieved documents.

3. **Generator**
   Synthesizes the extracted answers into natural, concise, and user-friendly responses tailored for Vietnamese legal language.
